## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Finding out about dbdiagram.io (from codepath) very user friendly and convinient in generating ERDs. Another thing was getting to make table relationships(one-to-many, many-to-many, etc) and see their representations helped my understanding of ralationships and foreign keys

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Scheduling a perfect time for meetups and knowing the efficient communication media for updates and collaboration.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Advice on serializing and storing request images for student uploads and database efficiency, or to just go with just storing image urls.
