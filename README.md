## About

### Description and Purpose

ServiceLink is a web application that allows students, faculty, and staff to report maintenance or IT issues around campus (e.g., broken lights, Wi-Fi outages, faulty lab equipment).
Administrators and technicians can review, prioritize, assign, and resolve these requests efficiently.
The platform improves communication between the campus community and the facilities department by providing real-time status tracking and automated updates.

### Inspiration

The inspiration for ServiceLink came from observing the inefficiency of traditional maintenance request systems on many campuses.
At most universities, students must email or physically report issues like broken AC units, malfunctioning projectors, or water leaks often without any way to track their request status.
This results in frustration, miscommunication, and redundant work for both students and staff.

By combining these ideas into a student-friendly, web-based platform, ServiceLink makes it easier for everyone on campus to ‚Äúsee a problem, report it, and track it.‚Äù
